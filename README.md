# Welcome to Bluemix

Cloud computing can be complex and confusing, but we're here to help you make sense of it. This is a technically focused set of pages that will allow you to explore the technology, see the latest best practices, and help you master cthe IBM Cloud.

This page is still taking shape, but it should always be in an "under construction" mode, as we remove links that are no longer relevant, and add links to new relevant materials.  The idea here is not to give you EVERY possible link on a topic, but instead to steer you to content that is high quality, and that has been applied in the real world.
